To create a **Web App for Helpdesk Access** that provides a URL where helpdesk personnel can guide users through identity verification or password reset processes, follow these steps. The web app will serve as an interface for helpdesk staff to initiate a user identity verification via **Microsoft Verified ID** and assist users in resetting their passwords securely.

### 1. **Prerequisites**
   - **Microsoft Entra Verified ID**: Ensure that your organization has access to this service, which is part of **Microsoft Entra**.
   - **Azure Active Directory**: You need AAD for managing users, configuring authentication policies, and enabling password resets.
   - **Authenticator App Setup**: Users need to have the **Microsoft Authenticator** app installed and configured for their accounts.
   - **Custom Web App**: A web application that can guide the helpdesk team and end-users through the verification process.

### Overview of the Web App Functionality:
1. **Helpdesk Access Page**: Helpdesk agents can log in and generate a unique URL to send to users.
2. **User Identity Verification**: The URL directs users to a page where they scan a QR code to verify their identity via **Microsoft Authenticator** or **Verified ID** credentials.
3. **Password Reset Assistance**: Once verified, the user can proceed to the password reset process.
4. **Admin Dashboard**: Helpdesk agents can track the status of verifications.

### Steps to Build the Web App

#### 1. **Set Up Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)**
- Ensure your Azure AD tenant is configured to support **Self-Service Password Reset (SSPR)** and **Microsoft Entra Verified ID**.
- Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) if required.

#### 2. **Create a New Web Application**
You can build a basic web app using technologies such as **ASP.NET Core**, **Node.js**, **Python Flask**, or **PHP**. For simplicity, this example assumes you're using **ASP.NET Core**.

- Create a new ASP.NET Core web app:
   ```bash
   dotnet new mvc -n HelpdeskApp
   cd HelpdeskApp
   dotnet run
   ```

- Set up a web page where helpdesk agents can generate URLs for users:
   - **/Home/Helpdesk**: Allows helpdesk agents to input a user ID or email to generate a unique link for user verification.
   - **/User/Verify**: This URL will be provided to the user to verify their identity.

#### 3. **Integrate Azure AD Authentication**
- **Secure the Web App**: Use Azure AD for authenticating helpdesk agents.
- In the Azure portal, register the app:
   - Go to **Azure Active Directory** → **App Registrations** → **New Registration**.
   - Provide a name and redirect URI for your app, such as `https://yourdomain.com/signin-oidc`.
   - Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** for use in the app.

- Configure the app to use Azure AD authentication. In **appsettings.json**, add:
   ```json
   "AzureAd": {
      "Instance": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/",
      "Domain": "yourdomain.com",
      "TenantId": "your-tenant-id",
      "ClientId": "your-client-id",
      "ClientSecret": "your-client-secret",
      "CallbackPath": "/signin-oidc"
   }
   ```

- Install necessary NuGet packages:
   ```bash
   dotnet add package Microsoft.Identity.Web
   ```

- Modify `Startup.cs` to configure Azure AD:
   ```csharp
   services.AddAuthentication(OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
       .AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApp(Configuration.GetSection("AzureAd"));
   ```

#### 4. **Generate QR Codes for User Verification**
Use a QR code generator to allow users to scan and verify their identity via **Microsoft Authenticator**.

- You can use libraries like **QRCoder** in ASP.NET Core:
   ```bash
   dotnet add package QRCoder
   ```

- In the **/User/Verify** page, generate a QR code containing a deep link to the **Microsoft Authenticator** app for the user to scan.

Here’s how you can generate a QR code for user verification:
```csharp
using QRCoder;
public IActionResult VerifyUser(string userId)
{
    // Build the verification URL
    string verificationUrl = "https://verify.yourdomain.com?user=" + userId;

    // Generate the QR code
    QRCodeGenerator qrGenerator = new QRCodeGenerator();
    QRCodeData qrCodeData = qrGenerator.CreateQrCode(verificationUrl, QRCodeGenerator.ECCLevel.Q);
    QRCode qrCode = new QRCode(qrCodeData);

    using (Bitmap bitmap = qrCode.GetGraphic(20))
    {
        using (MemoryStream ms = new MemoryStream())
        {
            bitmap.Save(ms, ImageFormat.Png);
            byte[] byteImage = ms.ToArray();
            return File(byteImage, "image/png");
        }
    }
}
```
This endpoint will generate a QR code that users can scan with their **Microsoft Authenticator** app.

#### 5. **Link the Web App to Verified ID**
You’ll need to integrate **Microsoft Entra Verified ID** to check the user’s credentials during verification. This involves:
- **Creating Verifiable Credentials**: Use **Microsoft Entra Verified ID** to issue verifiable credentials (e.g., employee IDs) to internal users.
- **API Integration**: Use the **Verified ID APIs** to interact with the credentials in your app and verify users when they scan the QR code.

#### 6. **Password Reset Workflow**
After the user’s identity is verified using **Microsoft Verified ID**, the app can redirect them to the **Self-Service Password Reset (SSPR)** page:
- Use **Azure AD SSPR** URL: `https://passwordreset.microsoftonline.com`.

Once the user is verified:
```csharp
return Redirect("https://passwordreset.microsoftonline.com");
```

#### 7. **Admin Dashboard for Helpdesk**
Create a simple dashboard where helpdesk agents can see the status of verifications:
- Track whether the user has scanned the QR code and completed the verification.
- Display logs of user activities for auditing purposes.

#### 8. **Deploy the Web App**
- **Azure App Service**: Deploy the web app on Azure App Service for easy scalability and management.
- **Custom Domain**: Ensure the web app is hosted on a domain that helpdesk agents and users can easily access, such as `helpdesk.yourdomain.com`.

#### 9. **Security Considerations**
- Ensure that all interactions between users and the app are encrypted using **HTTPS**.
- Secure sensitive information such as **User IDs** and **QR code tokens** using appropriate encryption.
- Use role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict helpdesk agents' access to only the necessary functions.

### Final Workflow:
1. **Helpdesk Agent Login**: Helpdesk agent logs into the web app.
2. **URL Generation**: Helpdesk agent enters the user's email or ID and generates a unique URL with a QR code.
3. **User Verification**: The user scans the QR code with **Microsoft Authenticator** or presents a **Verified ID** credential.
4. **Password Reset**: Upon successful verification, the user is redirected to the password reset page.
5. **Dashboard Monitoring**: The helpdesk agent can monitor the verification status through the dashboard.

This approach ensures a seamless identity verification and password reset process for users while providing helpdesk agents with a simple tool for assisting users.
