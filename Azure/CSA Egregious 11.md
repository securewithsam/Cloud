#### Strengthen your cloud security posture

âœ… 1. Data Breach
 ğŸ”¹ Double-check encryption settings â€” CSPs donâ€™t encrypt by default.
 ğŸ”¹ Ensure data at rest and in transit is encrypted.
âœ… 2. Misconfiguration & Inadequate Change Control
 ğŸ”¹ Remove default credentials for services and APIs.
 ğŸ”¹ Regularly review access controls and permissions.
âœ… 3. Lack of Cloud Security Architecture & Strategy
 ğŸ”¹ Conduct threat modeling â€” map assets, threats, and mitigations.
 ğŸ”¹ Disable unused services to reduce the attack surface.
âœ… 4. Insufficient Identity, Access, Key Management
 ğŸ”¹ Implement RBAC and 2FA for login.
 ğŸ”¹ Rotate keys and credentials regularly.
âœ… 5. Account Hijacking
 ğŸ”¹ Monitor all new account creations.
 ğŸ”¹ Set up alerts for suspicious login activity.
âœ… 6. Insider Threat
 ğŸ”¹ Use DLP to monitor and prevent data exfiltration.
 ğŸ”¹ Limit access based on the principle of least privilege.
âœ… 7. Insecure Interfaces & APIs
 ğŸ”¹ Enforce input validation for APIs.
 ğŸ”¹ Use CSP traffic throttling to block abuse.
âœ… 8. Weak Control Plane
 ğŸ”¹ Restrict control plane access with RBAC and MFA.
 ğŸ”¹ Limit administrative access to essential personnel only.
âœ… 9. Metastructure & Applistructure Failures
 ğŸ”¹ Patch regularly and monitor third-party app vulnerabilities.
 ğŸ”¹ Conduct supply chain security assessments.
âœ… 10. Limited Cloud Usage Visibility
 ğŸ”¹ Use EASM or CART to detect shadow IT.
 ğŸ”¹ Implement centralized logging and monitoring.
âœ… 11. Abuse and Nefarious Use of Cloud Services
 ğŸ”¹ Monitor for abnormal activity using CSP tools.
 ğŸ”¹ Maintain an approved list of apps and services.
